INSTALL

This package depends on the RDiscount, Sinatra, and Unicorn gems plus, of course, a Ruby interpreter.

Once the dependencies are met, run

    rackup

in the root directory (which contains config.ru) to start the application.

BUILDING

This package can be built as a debian binary (a work in progress).

Using vagrant ~> 1.7.2 and virtual box, issue the command:
  vagrant up
to bring up and provision a debian trusty x64 vm.

Run the command
  vagrant ssh -c "/vagrant/build.sh"
to generate a .deb file in the apt cache directory /var/cache/apt/archives

TODO

* Need to decide on a way to differentiate inferred tags and explicit tags.
* Need to exclude stop words and abbreviations.

* Use thor or make to improve the command line interface / targets.
* use guard to run thor/make when dependencies / fs files change.
* copy back build artifacts to the vm's shared directory.
* use anything smarter than shell scripts, and control builds with variables
* add daemon start/stop script to run, halt, restart service.
* create and use a www group (or www-data group) to restrict the service.
* test installation with kitchen (add tests that install the deb and verify service)
